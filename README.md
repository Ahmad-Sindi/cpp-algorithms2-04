# Algorithm Challenge #4 – Perfect Numbers from 1 to N
--
🧮 Problem Description
This algorithm reads a positive number N and prints all **Perfect Numbers** within the range 1 to N.  
A Perfect Number is a number equal to the sum of its proper divisors.  
Example: 28 → 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28

This exercise reinforces core concepts in loops, condition checking, and function modularity in C++.


💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Understanding Perfect Numbers and divisor logic
- Implementing loops to check all numbers in a range
- Modular function design for maintainable code
- Mathematical reasoning inside iterative structures
- Validating user input for correctness



🧩 Example

**Input:**
Please enter Positive Number to check Perfect Number: 30

**Output:**

6

28


📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++
